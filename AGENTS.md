# Colevity Car Tracking App – Agent Notes

## Tech Stack
- React 19 with Vite 7 (ESM, React Fast Refresh, preview/build via Vite)
- React Router DOM 7 for client-side routing
- Tailwind CSS 4 (configured through `@tailwindcss/postcss` with autoprefixer)
- Firebase v12 (Auth with Google provider + Firestore); env-driven config via `VITE_FIREBASE_*`
- ESLint flat config (recommended JS + React hooks/refresh rules)
- lucide-react icon set

## Directory Structure
- `index.html` – Vite entry mounting the React app.
- `public/` – static assets served as-is (e.g., `vite.svg`).
- `src/`
  - `main.jsx` bootstraps React; `App.jsx` wires routes and auth guard; `App.css`/`index.css` hold global styles.
  - `assets/` – static client assets (`react.svg`).
  - `components/`
    - `Layout.jsx` – app shell with nav/sidebar wrapping protected pages.
    - `Dashboard/` – dashboard UI pieces (`ActivitySection.jsx`, `AlertSection.jsx`, `FuelLogModal.jsx`, `VehicleCard.jsx`).
    - `ManageVehicles/` – vehicle editing modal (`EditVehicleModal.jsx`).
  - `pages/`
    - `Login.jsx` – Google auth flow.
    - `Dashboard.jsx` – vehicle overview cards and activity widgets.
    - `ManageVehicles.jsx` – CRUD and odometer updates for vehicles.
    - `Activities.jsx` – fuel log history and stats.
  - `services/`
    - `firebase.js` – initializes Firebase using `VITE_FIREBASE_*` env vars; exports `auth`, `db`, Google auth helpers.
    - `vehicleService.js` – Firestore CRUD for vehicles/fuel logs plus efficiency calculations.
- `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `eslint.config.js`, `vite.config.js` – build and tooling configuration.
- `firebase.json`, `.firebaserc`, `firestore.rules`, `apphosting.yaml` – Firebase hosting target (`dist`), project ID, security rules, and Cloud Run settings.
- `dist/` – production build output (generated by Vite).
- `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `.env` – dependencies/scripts and local env keys (Firebase values are expected in `.env` and are not checked in).

## Commands
- `npm install` – install dependencies.
- `npm run dev` – start Vite dev server with HMR.
- `npm run build` – create production build in `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` – serve the production build locally.
- `npm run start` – preview with host/port set for container use (`0.0.0.0:8080`).
- `npm run lint` – run ESLint flat config over the project.

## Practices
- Code should be well-commented
- Always run build to confirm changes did not break anything
